# Bot for help in the game Murder by Numbers

## Motivation
I'm currently playing the game  [*Murder by Numbers*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1140290/Murder_by_Numbers/). I’ve really enjoyed the story, but after solving around 100 puzzles, I’ve gotten a bit tired of them. However, I still want to finish the story, so I decided to create this bot to help me out.

In my searches I discovered that this type of game already has a name, more than one for say true, but the more comun if I understand well is Nonogram. After discover that, I searched about already maked logics for resolve the puzzle, and found a really ease to use librery named nonogram_cracker.

This project isn’t finished yet. Once it is, I’ll update this page with more details about its features and how to use it. Basically, my idea is to take a screenshot of the puzzle, feed it into the code, and have Python automatically interpret, solve, and "enter" the solution into the game.
