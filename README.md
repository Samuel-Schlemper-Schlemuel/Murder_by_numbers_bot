# Bot for help in the game Murder by Numbers

## Motivation
I'm currently playing the game  *[Murder by Numbers*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1140290/Murder_by_Numbers/). I’ve really enjoyed the story, but after solving around 100 puzzles, I’ve gotten a bit tired of them. However, I still want to finish the story, so I decided to create this bot to help me out.

This project isn’t finished yet. Once it is, I’ll update this page with more details about its features and how to use it. Basically, my idea is to take a screenshot of the puzzle, feed it into the code, and have Python automatically interpret, solve, and "enter" the solution into the game.
